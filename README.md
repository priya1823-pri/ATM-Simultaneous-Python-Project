ATM Simulator (Python Mini Project)

A simple console-based ATM Simulator written in Python. This mini project allows users to log in using a predefined username and PIN, then access basic ATM features such as depositing money, withdrawing money, viewing account statements, and changing the PIN.
All data (balance, PIN, username) is stored directly inside the source code — no database or external files required.
